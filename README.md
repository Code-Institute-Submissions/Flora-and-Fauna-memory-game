</ul>

<h2>UX</h2>

<b>Why Flora and Fauna is awesome</b>

<ul>
	<li>Whole design was thought of and exsecuten on adobe photoshop before programming</li>
	<li>Design is responsive allowing user to play on any device</li>
	<li>Users name is displayed on the screen during game</li>

</ul>

The game was created for people of any age that are looking for a fun way to spend a bit of free time and are looking for a game that would not only be entertaining but would also stimulate the brain. While game is kid friendly and easy to understand and navigate, it's primaraly purpose was to appeal for a grown-up who needs to add some fun into their busy scedule.

Game was designed to be responsive, intuitive and easy to use on any devices. Sounds were added to card flips to make it obvious when the match is made or card combination was wrong. Background sound was added in order to make game environment more engaging and stimulating, but the player that prefers soundless game can easily disable sound by clicking a speaker button which is displayed in the obvious place at the top of the screen and is easily recognisable as a tool for sound control.

Game consists of three levels which are increasing in coplexity by adding extra cards. Each level has flora and fauna theme separated by cathegory: 1st level is Sea-creatures sub-cathegory, 2nd level bugs/insects and third plants/flowers. Cathegories were split rather than mixed to increase player's interest in game, when looking forward what awaits on the next level. 

Once level is passed, pop up identifying the beginning of next level appears making it easy to follow progress in the game. If player has run out of given time or used up given amount of turns game over screen appears, a big and obvious button with text "Try Again" is displayed encorouging a player to start over. Once the game is won victory music is being played and "Congratulations" overlay fills the screen. Big button with words "Play again" appears similarly like in the "game over" state.

<h2>User stories</h2>

<ul>
	<li>As a person with a long commute to work I want something fun and engaing to make time go faster, I however prefer someting that is eye appealing and design not for children, so I don't feel embarassed if somebody on the bus is looking at my screen</li>
	<li>As a student I sometimes need to take a break from books and do something studies-unrelated to get my mind off things and give myself a break. A short game does it, I do enjoy a brain stimulating games though, in order to beat the guilt of wasting time</li>
	<li>As a person who doesn't like wasting time, I need an activity while I'm in the waiting rooms for appointments or in the que in the shop, a game that is easy enough yet with a little challenge makes time go faster</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>

Game environment is fully responsive allowing user to play on any devices, desktop version fits all the visual information on the screen without scrolling allowing user to see and engage with all the game features. For mobile view 1st level cards are displayed in pairs rather than in threes in attempt to keep card size larger and avoid unecessary white space at the bottom of the screen, as the number of cards increases one card is added to a row in order to keep row count the same there fore same amount of scrolling which allows user to see all the cards and timer at the same time.

i- icon for game instructions and speaker icon is added to the Log in page allowing user to familiarise with a game and decided whether they want sound effects or not before game starts. 

All levels of the game share same design theme (same headder displaying logo in the middle timer on the top left corner, flip count on the top right corner and a good luck message including their chosen name under the header). The only thing changing as the game progresses is the amount of cards displayed and the theme of the cards whick is divided in three categories. Log in page was created to go with an overall design using overlay of the same colour as dominant colour of the game background, same fonts and logo are also displayed. All the overlay displays such as: "You won", "game over", "next level" share exact same style and identical buttons to provide consistancy.

<h2>Log-in Page</h2>

Log in page is imediately displayed once user access game, it overlays all the content displaying large logo and requiring an input of the chosen name. If name hasn't been entered modal pops up alerting that name must be provided. at the top right corner of log-in page (top middle for mobile devices) user can navigate to "i" or "speaker" icons and read game rules as well as to disable sound effects. Once user has familiarised themselves with game rules, amended sound options and chosen a name they then press the button to start the game (it is also possible to access the game by pressing enter, in order to provide convenience).
